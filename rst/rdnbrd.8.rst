NAME
====
    rdnbrd - Redistribute IP neighbor (ARP/ND) daemon

SYNOPSIS
========
    rdnbrd [-h] [-d] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
===========

    rdnbrd is a lightweight daemon that monitors the IP neighbor table and
    adds the routes from the interfaces off of the switching ASIC into a
    non-main kernel routing table. From this non-main routing table, the
    routes can be appropriately imported into the main table and redistributed
    to other nodes via a standard routing protocol via a standard routing
    suite such as quagga.

    The daemon is started like any other service. For example, in debian, it is
    started as:

              systemctl start rdnbrd

    It is stopped similarly:

              systemctl stop rdnbrd

    The log generated by this daemon, if using a file method, is under /var/log
    in rdnbrd.log.

    To actually redistribute the entries exported by this daemon, the quagga
    configuration needs the following lines added, as an example, assuming 
    OSPF is the routing protocol:

              zebra.conf:
	          ip import-table 10
    
	      ospfd.conf:
	          router ospf
                      redistribute table

OPTIONS
=======

    -h, --help                        show this help message and exit
    -d, --daemon                      run as a daemon
    -v, --version                     print version number and exit

FILES
=====
    /etc/rdnbrd.conf is the configuration file for rdnbrd

BUGS
====
    In this version, only IPv4 ARP entry redistribute is supported.
